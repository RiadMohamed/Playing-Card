# Playing-Card

Playing Card game where the user chooses a random card from the card pool and has to choose the matching card that holds the same number, color and rank as the card the user chose/flipped. Every time the user chooses a wrong pair the cards are shuffled randomly across the screen in a smooth animated way on-screen. Very similar game as the concentration game but it adds the card decks logic in addition to cards motion.The game supports all iPhone sizes and models as well as all iPads, in both portrait mode and landscape mode.
